- **Abstract**: Rydberg-mediated quantum optics is a useful route toward deterministic quantum information processing based on single photons and quantum networks but is bottlenecked by the fast motional dephasing of Rydberg atoms. This paper proposes and experimentally demonstrates a method to suppress motional dephasing by applying an a priori unknown but correct phase to each Rydberg atom in an atomic ensemble.
